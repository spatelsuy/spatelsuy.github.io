			<h3>audio-to-text conversion system</h3>
			<text>
			An audio-to-text conversion system using <b>Whisper</b> and <b>FFmpeg</b> on Windows. 
			This program leverages the power of the Whisper model from <b>OpenAI</b> for accurate transcription, 
			combined with FFmpeg for audio processing, all within a Python environment. 
			This solution works completely offline, meaning no sensitive audio files or transcriptions are uploaded to the cloud — 
			keeping content <b>private and secure</b>, ensuring <b>data privacy and security.</b>

			<h3>Why C/C++</h3>
			<text>
			C++ is a high-performance language widely used in system programming, game development, AI, and embedded systems. 
			With efficient memory management and low-level control, it powers real-time applications, IoT devices, and modern software. 
			AI is expanding beyond cloud computing into embedded systems, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. 
			In resource-constrained environments, efficient programming with C/C++ remains crucial for real-time AI applications. 
			Evolving with standards like C++23, it remains a versatile choice for embedded systems and advanced software development.
