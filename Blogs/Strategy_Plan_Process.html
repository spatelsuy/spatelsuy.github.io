      <h2>What is strategy, plan, process and framework?</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <p>
          We do use these words very often in corporate world, a strategy, a plan, a process and a framework. Sometime we use the words interchangeably and with no proper definition we get confuse and make others confused.

          I thought, it might be a good idea to come up with a write up.

          When I say, I have a strategy to improve performance of the application, I have a solution to move from the current state of performance to desired state of performance. There might be some constraints or uncertainty (opposing force) and I need to deal with that. The constraints or uncertainty may inhibit me to reach the desire performance. I need to do something to increase the probability of success, create a condition that favor me to reach the desire state.

          If you read the above sentences, I have tried to address “What”, what is the problem, what is the solution, what am I trying to do etc. I have a solution to my problem in “what” form, it is called strategy.
        </div>
        <div>
          As of now, I have not decided how to reach the desire performance. For this, I need to ask the similar set of questions using “How”. How to improve the performance, how to manage the constraints, and how many days it will take to solve the problem etc. Answer to questions with “How” brings the plan. So strategy is basically what I want to do and plan is how I will do it. The plan should support my strategy. We should have a “strategic planning” for our problems. In many cases, both strategy and plan occur simultaneously. For a given problem there might be more than one ways to solve “how to do it” (plan).

        <div>
          Now I have solution to execute to reach my desire state of application performance. I got set of tasks in my plan to execute. I need to arrange the tasks for a better result. It can be sequence/linear or branch (different options). Executing “how” or "the plan" in a certain a way is called process. Process defines a way to do a task. Executing task in a certain way may eliminate the constraints and create a favorable condition to achieve the result. Process can be essential part of a strategy.
        </div>
        <div>
          A framework in other way is a well tested structure or pattern. Using a framework (if exist), I can execute the process in a defined way to improve performance with no much R&D or I can develop a framework to solve similar problem in future.
