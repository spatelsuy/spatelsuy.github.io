What is Adaptive Authentication?
Adaptive Authentication is an approach that dynamically adjusts authentication requirements based on real-time risk factors. Instead of applying the same security measures to every login attempt, it analyzes context and decides whether to prompt for additional verification.
Adaptive authentication evaluates multiple risk-based factors, such as:
Who is trying to log in (user identity & role)
Where they are logging in from (location)
When they are accessing (time of access)
How they are logging in (device & behavior)

Example:
Low-Risk Scenario: A user logs in from their usual device and location: Only a password is required.
High-Risk Scenario: A login attempts from an unusual country or a new device: The system triggers Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or denies access.

Why is Adaptive Authentication Important?
Improves security by detecting suspicious activities
Enhances user experience by reducing unnecessary authentication prompts
Supports Zero Trust Security by verifying risk in real time
