Why reconciliation Is Still Needed in a Centralized IAM System?


Even though all systems rely on a single IAM for authentication and authorization, the IAM system itself does not control every aspect of identity and access within target applications. Here’s why reconciliation is still important:

Some applications may allow administrators to manually modify user roles, permissions, or accounts within their own settings. If an admin bypasses IAM and grants access directly in an application, IAM won’t be aware of this change. In this case Recon helps detect and correct these unauthorized changes.

Even in a centralized IAM, synchronization delays or failures can cause inconsistencies. A user might be removed from IAM but still retain access in an application due to a sync failure. If an employee leaves the organization, IAM should deactivate their accounts. However, in some cases, the target system may still retain the account due to deprovisioning delays or failures.
Recon helps identify and remove these orphaned accounts, reducing security risks.

Over time, users may accumulate additional roles and privileges that IAM is unaware of. A user initially granted "Read-Only" access in IAM might later receive "Admin" rights within the application. Recon helps detect such privilege escalations and enforce IAM governance policies.

Some legacy applications may not fully support real-time IAM integration and might maintain cached identity data. In this case Recon ensures that any outdated access information is corrected.

Regulatory standards like SOX, GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 require periodic verification that IAM permissions match actual system access.
Even if IAM is the single source of truth, auditors still require reconciliation reports to prove there are no unauthorized access discrepancies.
