IT support (also known as IT operation) service is not new. But the expectation is changing due to varying business needs and conditions. Business organizations want to provide best and instant service to their customers through 24x7 support model.

To meet the need, the service organizations are adopting bot, AI, advance analytics, automation, and/or a shared resource model. Also, it is crucial to have define right support level (L1, L2, L3 and L4) with right capacity, capability, responsibility, and knowledge. While L1 and L4 are distinct, there are ambiguities in L2 and L3. Many organizations do not differentiate L2 and L3. A single team perform all the works. It means, a highly technically qualified person end of doing repetitive work and over a period lose interest. A newcomer struggles to get solution, spend lot of time, and miss SLA.


The above diagram depicts incidents flow to manage incidents in different level based on capability and responsibility.

L1 or helpdesk is first line of support. L1 personnel handle incident management. They receive telephone call, email, chat from a customer and acknowledge the incident. They are not technical people. With basic product knowledge and by following standard documented process (cookbook recipe) they resolve incidents like password reset, installation, and uninstallation of applications. If L1 team cannot resolve an incident, they transfer it to L2 team. L1 team must update the incident with right information before transferring. It helps L2 team to analyze and resume the work from where L1 team left.

L2 team is qualified technician for the application and technology. They get access to applications, back-end systems and other diagnosis tools. L2 personnel handle incidents that are routed by L1 or from monitoring and system alerts. While L2 follow run books for a solution, they also use technical knowledge to analyze the incident for a solution. If require, they interact with another team. If L2 team cannot resolve an incident, they transfer it to L3 team. L2 team must update the incident with right information before transferring. It helps L3 team to analyze and resume the work from where L2 team left.

L2 team also performs health check, housekeeping, planned maintenance activities, and update or create new run books to address similar incidents in future.

Everyone wants a quick solution from an expert. L3 team members are experts. Wrong assignment of incidents to L3 team means an expert doing something different. It may affect operation. Hence, L2 should sealed L3 and assign incidents that they cannot resolve.

L3 resolve incidents that are difficult. They also take care of break fixes, minor enhancements, problem management, application stability analysis, proactive problem identification and look for continuous improvement. L3 also analyze outcome of L2â€™s housekeeping and maintenance activities.

The development team or product support team are L4. L3 connects with L4 for product or any enhancement related activities.

Business conditions are changing. The service and business organizations have adopted or adopting shared resource for the new delivery model. The shared resource can reduce cost, enhance standardization, and shared experiences/best practices across projects. Shared resources support multiple different projects from different clients, and they may like one project over another, which can affect client delivery.

Following are the few points that can enhance effectiveness of shared resource model.

An operating model, operational manual
RACI matrix
Prioritization of client work
Forecasting and estimate the work
Change calendar
Set remainder for important work
Group projects with same set of products / package application
Shared services
Run books, education and training
A moderator
