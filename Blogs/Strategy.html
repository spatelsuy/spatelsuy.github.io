    <h2>Statistics Matters – Small or Big Data</h2>

    <p>
      Statistics is study of data. We collect, organize, analyze, interpret and present the data, which is called information. It is very important for an individual or organization as the statistical data influence decisions. It helps to identify and recognize patterns within the data and make decisions based on it. In your organization if you want to seize a process (may be related to IT Security) or want to develop a new product (may be business growth), you need BVA, CBA etc. To realize the initiatives you need proper attention, motivation and support from C-level executive, the sponsor, stakeholder, governance and the team working in the ground. You need statistical information to show the progress and value of their time and money, this will gain their prudent and profound motivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statistics touch every part of daily life, knowingly or unknowingly we use statistics almost in everything.  If I ask you the question “What time usually you reach office?” you do not answer based on the time you arrived in office today, but you consider past few days or weeks to arrive a suitable answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statistics elicit. To stay motivated, you need to use statistics. For your weight loss program, apart from diet control and exercise, keep track of your progress by writing it down. You may need to use a chart to track day to day data. This data will provide trend analysis and boost your good feeling. I personally have used this technique and got benefited. I am able to reduce my body weight (approx. 30 LBs) from obsessed to normal in about 6 months. In year 2011, I started exercise and every day spent at least 45 minutes in gym for 4 months continuously. I did not get the expected results although I was trying different options. I lost the interest and stopped going to gym for almost 3 years. The self-management and self-healing concept motivated me again in 2014. Enthusiasm is necessary to accomplish something. But the question was, how should I keep my motivation level up? My previous failure and research taught me to keep track my daily activities including diet and calories I burned by walking or running. While mentally tired, but to keep walking or running physically, diverted my mind by counting and synchronizing breathing with the counting and keep going.

      The data I collected within few days really increased my motivational level. Everyone is different, the same food, eating pattern and same amount of exercise give result differently to different person. The data and analysis I did helped me to find right diet, right amount of exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be proud of every step you take towards reaching your goal. Each step may not give you a quantifiable result, but the data you get will help you to move to next step. The statistics matters, because it helps you to be passionate, be positive, be creative, be proactive, and be patient. You can have amazing enthusiasm with full motivation within yourself.
    </p>

      As an individual you do small data analysis for better life where as organizations perform big data analysis to make informed business decisions. Organizations perform big data analytics to uncover unknowns that lead to effective customer satisfactions, revenue opportunities, improve operational activities and other business benefits.

    <p>
      The core is data, analysis and interpret. As a matter of fact statistics matters.
