  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This privacy policy explains how data is handled in this app, blog, and associated learning tools provided through direct URLs or mobile platforms like the Google Play Store.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>This platform does not require user authentication and does not actively collect personal information such as names, emails, or addresses.</p>

  <h2>2. Use of Input Data</h2>
  <p>Some learning tools (e.g., text summarization, PDF merging, speech-to-text conversion) may ask users to provide text or files. These inputs are used temporarily to perform the requested action. No data is stored, logged, or shared.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-party APIs and Libraries</h2>
  <p>Some features use open-source models and APIs (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, Python GenAI libraries). Data may be passed to these libraries for processing. These libraries typically do not retain data, but users should avoid uploading sensitive or confidential information.</p>

  <h2>4. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
  <p>This platform does not use analytics, cookies, or tracking technologies.</p>

  <h2>5. External Links</h2>
  <p>There are links to other websites, GitHub repositories, and tools. These external sites operate independently and have their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Reasonable steps are taken to ensure the safety of your input during processing. However, for tasks involving sensitive data, it is advised not to use public tools.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not intended for children under 13. No content is targeted specifically at children.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated date.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions or concerns about this policy, reach out via <a href="mailto:your-email@example.com">email</a> or through social platforms listed in the app.</p>
