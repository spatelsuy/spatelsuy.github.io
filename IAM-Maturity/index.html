<h2>IAM Maturity Assessment</h2>

<div class="definition">
<h3>What is Identity and Access Management (IAM)?</h3>
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the foundation of digital trust in an organization. It is the framework of policies, processes, and technologies used to manage digital identities and control 
who can access what, when, and how. It ensures the right people have the right access at the right time, enforces security policies, and prevents unauthorized access, protecting critical information assets.
<br>
IAM brings together three critical capabilities:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Identity Governance & Administration (IGA):</li>
  Managing the lifecycle of identities and access — from onboarding (Joiner), role changes (Mover), to exit (Leaver). This includes access requests, approvals, certifications, and compliance reporting.
  <li>Access Management:</li>
  Controlling authentication and authorization to applications, systems, APIs, and data — including Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and federation.
  <li>AAA Principles (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting):</li>
  Verifying identity, enforcing access decisions, and recording access activity for security, audit, and investigation.
  <br>
  Together, IAM ensures that the right people have the right access at the right time, for the right reasons, while protecting applications, data, brand reputation, and customer trust.  
</ul>
</div>

<div class="definition">
<h2>What is IAM Maturity & Why it Matters?</h2>
<p>IAM Maturity measures how effectively and consistently an organization manages identities and access across its environment and how well it is performing under real-world conditions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Security threats and identity-based attacks</li>
  <li>Regulatory audits and compliance requirements</li>
  <li>Business growth, cloud adoption, and digital transformation</li>
  <li>Mergers, acquisitions, and organizational change</li>
</ul>

A higher IAM maturity indicates that IAM processes are:
<ul>
	<li>Predictable instead of reactive</li>
    <li>Consistent instead of fragmented</li>
    <li>Risk aware</li>
    <li>Aligned with industry frameworks and business priorities</li>
</ul>
Assessing IAM maturity helps organizations:
<ul>
<li>Identify gaps, risks, and control weaknesses</li>
<li>Prioritize IAM investments and automation</li>
<li>Measure progress over time</li>
<li>Align IAM capabilities with frameworks such as NIST, CRI, ISO, and industry expectations</li>
<li>Communicate IAM posture clearly to executives, auditors, and regulators</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="definition">
<h3>How IAM Maturity is Calculated</h3>
IAM maturity is not measured by a single control or tool.
It is calculated through a structured, domain-based assessment that evaluates how IAM capabilities are designed, implemented, and operated.
The calculation follows these stages:
<ul>
<li>Defining IAM Domains (Areas of Capability)</li>
The first step in measuring IAM maturity is to identify the key functional areas or domains that represent the organization’s IAM capabilities. 
These domains act as pillars of the assessment, covering both governance and operational aspects of identity and access management.
Domains are designed to reflect how IAM actually works in real organizations, not just how it is described in standards.
<br>
Typical IAM domains include identity lifecycle, access governance, authentication, privileged access, and monitoring.
	
<li>Assessing Each Domain Through Targeted Questions</li>
Once IAM domains are defined, the next step is to evaluate how mature each domain is by asking specific, scenario-based questions that focus on real capabilities instead of asking abstract or purely technical questions. 
Each question presents descriptive maturity statements that reflect common real-world practices.

<li>Scoring Each Question Using a 1–5 Maturity Scale</li>
Each question maps to a maturity score from 1 to 5, based on the selected description.
The score reflects how mature, consistent, and risk-aware the capability is.
The scale is designed to show progression, from ad-hoc practices to optimized, automated operations.

<li>Calculating the Domain-Level Maturity Score</li>
Once all questions within a domain are scored, the results are combined to calculate a domain-level maturity score.
This score represents how mature the organization is in that specific IAM capability area.
Domain scores make it easier to see strengths and weaknesses, rather than hiding issues in a single overall number.

<li>Calculating Overall IAM Maturity</li>
The overall IAM maturity score is calculated by combining the maturity scores across all domains.
This provides a holistic view of the organization’s IAM capability.

<li>Mapping Scores to Maturity Levels (Level 1–5)</li>
To make results meaningful and actionable, numeric scores are mapped to descriptive maturity levels.
This allows executives, security leaders, and auditors to quickly understand the organization’s IAM standing and improvement path.
</ul>

<h3>Domains Considered in IAM Maturity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Identity Lifecycle Management (Joiner-Mover-Leaver)</li>
  <li>Access Governance (IGA, approvals, access reviews)</li>
  <li>Authentication & MFA</li>
  <li>Privileged Access Management (PAM)</li>
  <li>Monitoring & Logging</li>
</ul>

<div class="definition">
<h3>Maturity Score Measurement</h3>
<p>Each question is scored 1–5. Definitions:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Score</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Ad-hoc, manual, inconsistent</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Partially implemented, limited consistency</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Defined, documented, repeatable</td></tr>

<h2>Interactive IAM Maturity Scoring</h2>

<h3>1. Identity Lifecycle Management (Joiner–Mover–Leaver)</h3>
<p>
This domain assesses how effectively identities are created, modified, and removed across their lifecycle,
from onboarding (Joiner) through role changes (Mover) to termination (Leaver).
