  <h2>IAM Maturity Assessment – Version 1 (Banking Scope)</h2>

  <p>
    This IAM Maturity Assessment provides a structured, AI-assisted way to evaluate how
    effectively an organization manages identities and access.
    Version 1 (V1) is intentionally scoped to the <strong>Banking industry</strong>,
    where regulatory expectations and risk tolerance are high.
  </p>

  <h3>What This Assessment Covers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Identity Lifecycle Management</strong> – Joiner, Mover, Leaver processes</li>
    <li><strong>Access Governance</strong> – Access requests, approvals, and reviews</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication & MFA</strong> – Authentication strength and MFA usage</li>
    <li><strong>Privileged Access Management</strong> – Control of privileged accounts</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring & Logging</strong> – Visibility and oversight of IAM activity</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How Maturity Is Measured</h3>
  <p>
    Users select the option that best reflects their current practice for each question.
    Each option represents a baseline maturity level (1–5).
    An AI-based assessment agent then evaluates the selection using banking-aligned
    expectations, regulatory context, and IAM architecture to determine a final maturity score.
  </p>

  <h3>Maturity Levels</h3>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Level</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>Ad-hoc, manual, inconsistent</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>Partially implemented, limited consistency</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>Defined, documented, repeatable</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>Managed, integrated, measured</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td><td>Optimized, automated, continuously improved</td></tr>
  </table>

  <h3>Framework Alignment</h3>
  <p>
    This assessment is aligned with NIST CSF (PR.AA), ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A.9),
    and the CRI Identity Risk framework.
    It provides maturity insight but does not replace formal audits or certifications.
  </p>

  <h3>Version Scope</h3>
  <p>
    V1 is limited to the Banking industry. Future versions will expand coverage
    to additional industries and include enhanced evidence-based scoring.
